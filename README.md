## Learning Notes

### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

### PHP

* Always use `===` when you are comparing True, False, or Null since they are super easy to be converted into integers. Don't overuse it either.
* `True` turns into 1, but `False` doesn't print (either `echo` or `print`), but `var_dump` will show `False`.
* `.` for concatenation.
* Use **single quotes** whenever you can.
* A **while loop** is a "zero-trip" loop with the test on top, before the first iteration starts. If the statement is false it won't execute the loop body even once.
* A **do-while loop** is a "one-trip" loop with the test at the bottom after the first iteration completes.
